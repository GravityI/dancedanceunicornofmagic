Sinister Uni McOrn
A Short Story
by UwU
Uni McOrn looked at the magic gun in his hands and felt Happy.

He walked over to the window and reflected on his Cybernetic surroundings. He had always loved Dead Dance Arena with its melted, manky Machine invasion. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel Happy.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Dancing Unicorn. Dancing was a brave monster with dirty arms and fat horn.

Uni gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a sinister, predator, whiskey drinker with wide arms and ruddy horn. His friends saw him as a good, gigantic gamer. Once, he had even made a cup of tea for a shivering Unicorn.

But not even a sinister person who had once made a cup of tea for a shivering Unicorn, was prepared for what Dancing had in store today.

The moon shone like dancing horse, making Uni Shocked.

As Uni stepped outside and Dancing came closer, he could see the horrible glint in his eye.

"I am here because I want World peace," Dancing bellowed, in a funny tone. He slammed his fist against Uni's chest, with the force of 9706 unicorn. "I frigging love you, Uni McOrn."

Uni looked back, even more Shocked and still fingering the magic gun. "Dancing, lET'S DANCE," he replied.

They looked at each other with Enraged feelings, like two petite, powerful pony shooting at a very optimistic Party, which had Disco music playing in the background and two stupid uncles rampaging to the beat.

Uni regarded Dancing's dirty arms and fat horn. He held out his hand. "Let's not fight," he whispered, gently.

"Hmph," pondered Dancing.

"Please?" begged Uni with puppy dog eyes.

Dancing looked Agitated, his body blushing like a blue, beautiful boombox.

Then Dancing came inside for a nice glass of whiskey.
